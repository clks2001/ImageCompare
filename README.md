ImageCompare
============

This program detects duplicate images in a directory and it's subdirectories. The user supplies the URL of a directory on their computer, and the program searches all the files in the directory (and it's sub directories) for any images that are duplicates. Useful for when dealing with a hard drive backup that creates duplicate images.
